# Face-Detection-and-Auto-Image-Saving-with-OpenCV

This project utilizes the OpenCV library for face detection and automatic image saving.

How it Works:

The program prompts the user for a name to label and name the folder.
The camera is activated.
Once a full face is detected in front of the camera, 500 images are automatically captured.
All images are saved in JPG format in a folder with the chosen name and numbered sequentially.
Points to Consider:

To use this program, OpenCV must be installed on your system.
Ensure your camera is properly configured.
Proper lighting is essential for face detection.
How to Use:

Run the program.
Enter your desired name for labeling and folder name.
Stand facing the camera until 500 images are captured of you.
The images will be saved in a folder with the chosen name.
