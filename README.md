# Face-Detection-and-Auto-Image-Saving-with-OpenCV
This OpenCV project automatically captures and saves 500 images of a user's face once a full face is detected. The user is prompted to enter a name for the folder and label before the capturing process begins. Images are saved in JPG format within the specified folder with sequential numbering.
