# Face-Detection-and-Auto-Image-Saving-with-OpenCV

##  This project utilizes the OpenCV library for face detection and automatic image saving.


##  How it Works:

The program prompts the user for a name to label and name the folder.
The camera is activated.
Once a full face is detected in front of the camera, 500 images are automatically captured.
All images are saved in JPG format in a folder with the chosen name and numbered sequentially.

##  Points to Consider:

[x] To use this program, OpenCV must be installed on your system.
[x] Ensure your camera is properly configured.
[x] Proper lighting is essential for face detection.

##How to Use:

##  Run the program.
[x] Enter your desired name for labeling and folder name.
[x] Stand facing the camera until 500 images are captured of you.
[x] The images will be saved in a folder with the chosen name.
